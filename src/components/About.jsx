      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a student web developer passionate about building modern,
        responsive applications with JavaScript. While I am still
        learning and expanding my knowledge, I have a strong interest in
        creating clean and user-friendly designs. I enjoy solving problems,
        exploring new technologies, and collaborating with others on projects
        that challenge me to grow. My goal is to keep improving my skills and
        apply them to real-world projects that make a positive impact.
